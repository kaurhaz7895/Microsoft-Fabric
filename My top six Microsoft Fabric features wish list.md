# My top six Microsoft Fabric features wish list

I have gone a long way in exploring the Microsoft Fabric and am constantly returning to comparing it with Azure Databricks.

And at this point, it is only fair to give some context. I have been using Power BI from the start and have loved it ever since. Many of the wishes for Fabric are based and rooted in the Power BI Services experience. At the same time, I have been using Azure Databricks, continuously since 2019. I have to admit, I loved all the changes they have done to the service, interface and general operability. I have also worked extensively with Jupyter notebooks and Spark.


Here are my takes:

1. Improved Notebooks (with Widgets and the ability to work interactively with data frames)
3. Native integration with shell / CMD as an extension to the environment for coding and administration/management
4. User Interface that follows more intuitively the end-users, power-users or admins through their work processes (regarding using domains)
5. Making easier operability using notebooks and power BI datasets, semantic models
6. Whitelist and concepts on naming conventions for better clarity and visibility
2. More visible source system integration
